simpleconfig - a simple configuration file library for go
=========================================================

simpleconfig is a trivial configuration file library for config files
following the key=value format. The format uses `#` as the comment sign. Think
of, how `bash` treats assignments and comments and you get the idea. 

example config file
-------------------

This file is used by [kurz.go](http://github.com/fs111/kurz.go) from, which
`simpleconfig` library was extracted:

    # port to listen on
    port=9999

    # listen only on loopback
    listen=127.0.0.1

    # hostname to use
    hostname=localhost:9999

    # redis related settings
    redis.netaddress=tcp:localhost:6379
    redis.database=0
    redis.password=

    # directory to serve static files
    static-directory=static

Usage
=====
    
    import (
        "github.com/fs111/simpleconfig"
    )

      
    func main(){
        cfg, err := NewConfig("/path/to/config")
        if err != nil{
            // handle error  
        }

        // get a string value from the config
        // handle error, if necessary...
        val, e := cfg.GetString("key")
        

        // get a string, but return a default, if it's not set
        // if the key "ook?" does not exist, it will return "ook!", otherwise it
        // will return the value from the config file
        val, e := cfg.GetStringDefault("ook?", "ook!") 

        // same API for integers
        intVal, e := cfg.GetInt("somekey")

        // or

        intVal := cfg.GetIntDefault("answer", 42)

    }
